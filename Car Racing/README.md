# Car Race Game with Bot

This is a simple 2D car racing game built using Python and Pygame. The game features a single-player mode where you race against a computer-controlled car, navigating through a track, avoiding collisions, and aiming to finish the race first. The game also supports multiple levels with increasing difficulty. 

## Features:
- **Single-player Mode**: Race against a computer-controlled car (AI).
- **Level Progression**: Complete levels to unlock the next ones.
- **Car Movement**: Use arrow keys or `WASD` to control the player car's direction and speed.
- **Collisions**: The player and computer cars collide with track borders and the finish line, with corresponding behaviors (bounce, reset, level up).
- **Game Finish**: When you finish all levels, you win the game.
